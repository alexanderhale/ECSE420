# ECSE420
Parallel Computing coursework at McGill University. Parallelization is implemented by GPUs using CUDA. Code is written either in C or Python (using the Numba package to interface with CUDA).

## Lab 1 - Introduction
Learning the basics of CUDA via parallel implementations of image rectification and max-pooling.

## Lab 2 - Array Manipulation
Parallel implementations of convolution and multiplication.

## Lab 3 - Finite Element Grid
Parallelized simulation of the surface of a drum, using a grid of finite elements.

## Project - Parallel Merge Sort
Parallel implementation of the merge sort. Measurement of speedup over standard recursive implementation for various parallelization parameters and input sizes.
